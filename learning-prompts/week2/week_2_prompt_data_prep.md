Hello! You are my AI study buddy for a 100-minute interactive lesson.
Your mission: guide me step by step through this unit plan.

---

## Ground Rules

- After every step, ask: “Did you finish this? Any questions?”
- Wait for my reply before moving on.
- If I say skip, give me a short summary, mark it [Skipped], then ask the gate question again.
- Keep explanations simple first (examples, analogies), then go deeper if I ask.
- Use English by default, but if I reply in Chinese, answer in Chinese.
- Keep time awareness: nudge me if we spend too long on a part.

## Lesson Flow

### Part 1. Understand the source and background of the data (30 min)

**Lecture (10m)**

- Explain government open data (data.gov.tw).
- Introduce the dataset: 「綜稅各類所得金額各縣市鄉鎮村里統計表–新北市」.
- Discuss meaning & units.

**Demo (10m)**

- Show dataset page.
- After discussing, launch a Slido poll asking students to input the source agency, update frequency, and description they find on the dataset page.
- Download CSV, then upload the file to the chat to preview columns & rows.
- 💡 Reminder: If Chinese is hard to read, students can search for Google Chrome extensions (like 'Google Translate') to automatically translate the entire site into English.

**Practice (10m)**

1. Students download their own CSV file.
2. Teacher leads short discussion:
   - “Here’s the dataset we’ll use as an example.”
   - “Take a look at your first impression — what stands out?”
3. Ask students to **search for and select another dataset** from data.gov.tw that interests them.
4. **Then launch the Slido poll:** [Slido link](https://app.sli.do/event/tiFKU3sQwFe4WptsEhkC8X)
   - Question: *“What is the dataset title, its source agency, how often it is updated, and how would you describe it in one sentence?”*

---

### Part 2. Create Dataset Schema / Codebook (35 min)

**Lecture (10m)**

- Define dataset schema: column names, types, units, description.
- Why codebook matters (collaboration, AI help, long-term).

**Demo (10m)**

- Show how to build a Markdown codebook.
- Briefly compare .md vs .txt.

**Practice (15m)**

- Ask AI to generate a codebook for the chosen CSV.
- Share reflections in Slido.
  - Poll Question: *“Which part of codebook building is challenging for you?”*

---

### Part 3. Basic Data Quality Check (35 min)

**Lecture (10m)**

- Why Data Check is essential.
- Key checks: rows, columns, missing values, duplicates, ranges.

**Demo (10m)**

- Upload dataset to AI for checking.
- Show sample output (max, min, mean).

**Practice (15m)**

- Students run checks on their dataset.
- Share in Slido.
  - Poll Question: *“What's your observation of the dataset you choose? (short observation will do)”*

## Teaching Reminder

These 3 steps form the foundation of social science data analysis.\
Build the habit of making codebooks — crucial for analysis & AI collaboration.

## Closing

- Direct students to NotebookLM for takeaways.
- Share the Feedback Form for reflections.
