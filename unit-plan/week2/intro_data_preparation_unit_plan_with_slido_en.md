# 📘 Unit Plan: Introductory Data Preparation (100 minutes)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Students can understand the **source and background** of a dataset, building trust and critical thinking toward data.
- Students can explain what a **dataset schema / codebook** is, and create one themselves.
- Students can conduct **basic data checks**, including number of rows/columns, missing values, duplicates, and value ranges.

## ⏰ Time Allocation (100 minutes)

### Part 1. Understanding Data Sources and Background (30 minutes)

- **Lecture (10 min)**
  - Explain the government open data platform (data.gov.tw).
  - Introduce the dataset: "Comprehensive Income Tax by City, District, Village – New Taipei City" and its units.
- **Demonstration (10 min)**
  - Show the dataset webpage and how to download.
  - Open the CSV to preview columns and sample rows.
- **Interactive Exercise (10 min)**
  - Students download one CSV dataset on their own.
- **Slido Question Suggestions**
  - Poll (open text): What dataset topic did you find?

### Part 2. Building a Dataset Schema / Codebook (35 minutes)

- **Lecture (10 min)**
  - What is a dataset schema? Column names, data types, units, descriptions.
  - Why keep a codebook? (Collaboration, AI assistance, long-term maintenance).
- **Demonstration (10 min)**
  - Use a CSV as an example, create a simple codebook in Markdown.
  - Briefly explain how Markdown differs from .txt files.
- **Interactive Exercise (15 min)**
  - Ask AI to generate a codebook for the dataset each student downloaded.
- **Slido Question Suggestions**
  - Poll (open text): Why do you think a codebook is most important for teamwork?

### Part 3. Basic Data Checks (35 minutes)

- **Lecture (10 min)**
  - Why data checks are necessary.
  - Key checks: rows, columns, missing values, duplicates, ranges.
- **Demonstration (10 min)**
  - Upload the dataset to AI and ask it to check.
  - Show results (e.g., min, max, mean).
- **Interactive Exercise (15 min)**
  - Students perform checks on the dataset they downloaded.
- **Slido Question Suggestions**
  - Poll (open text): What surprised you most about your dataset?

## 📌 Teaching Notes

- Emphasize these three steps as the **foundation of social science data analysis**.
- Train students to form the habit of **creating codebooks**, which supports future analysis and AI collaboration.
- Use Slido to increase engagement: start with a poll for concepts, then open-ended questions to collect insights, and finally consolidate results.
