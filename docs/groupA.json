    "I showed how to perform data analysis on a dataset regarding a survey done towards students around the world about how much they use social media in everyday life. I used Google Colab and R language to perform data analysis such as data cleaning, data summarization and visualization to come up with the conclusion that among students, high school students are the most susceptible towards social media addiction as they spend the most time in a day to browse social media, hence feeling that their academic performance and mental health are worsened.",
