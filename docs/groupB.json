    "Understanding Student Wellbeing from Lifestyle and Academic Factors",
    "https://youtu.be/eOlQSC4nk3k",
    "Overall, the analysis shows that lifestyle and academic factors are closely related to student wellbeing. Students generally experience moderate academic pressure and study hours, while dietary habits and sleep patterns show noticeable associations with academic performance and satisfaction. Healthier diets are linked to slightly higher CGPA, higher academic pressure is associated with longer study hours, and balanced sleep duration around 5-8 hours is related to better academic outcomes and stable study satisfaction. Although this exploratory analysis does not prove causation, it provides a strong starting point for understanding how everyday lifestyle and academic demands may influence student wellbeing.",
